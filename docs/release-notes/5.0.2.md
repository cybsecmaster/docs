# 5.0.2 - 8 April 2022

We found a bug that prevents a user from using the reset pasword flow (present in 5.0.0).
We recommend all 5.0.x users to update to this version.

## Fixes

- Fix 404 page during the reset password flow
- Dashboard: include end date in time interval
- Fix detached live feed when using an http context
