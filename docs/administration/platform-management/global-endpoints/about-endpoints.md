# About Endpoints

There are several type of endpoints available in TheHive: Webhook, Mattermost, Slack, HTTP, Emailâ€¦ Every organisations can activate their own endpoints but organisations don't share their endpoints with other organisations.

For example, you can have an endpoint that will create a JIRA ticket for every case created in your TheHive organisation.
