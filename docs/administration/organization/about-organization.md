# About Organization

In TheHive, organisations are like teams. Each teams will have their own users, cases, alerts, observables, etc

TheHive comes with a default organisation named "admin" and is dedicated to users with administrator permissions of TheHive instance. This organisation is very specific so that it can manage global objects and cannot contain cases or any other related elements.

By default, organisations canâ€™t see each other and can't share data.
