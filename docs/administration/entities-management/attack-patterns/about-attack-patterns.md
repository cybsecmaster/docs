# About Attack Patterns


MITRE ATT&CKÂ® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community. They classify those behaviors on tactics, and within each tactic, they define many techniques. These techniques are the cells in the MITRE ATT&CK matrix. 

ATT&CK, which stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge, can help you understand how cyber attackers think and work.

The matrix allows you to give an overview of how the attacker did the attack, by which phases they went through.

In TheHive, you can import the MITRE ATT&CK framework and assign tactics, techniques & procedures you spotted during investigations to a Case

You can view all the attack patterns on the Entities Management page, in the Attack Patterns tab.
