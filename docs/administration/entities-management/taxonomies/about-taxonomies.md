# About Taxonomies

TheHive support taxonomies as they are defined and published by MISP.

You can import catalogs of taxonomies and use them to classify cases, alerts and observables. TheHive allows you to disable the catalogs you won't use.

> By default, TheHive does not contain any taxonomy.

You can view the list of all imported taxonomies  on the Entities Management page, in the Taxonomies tab.
